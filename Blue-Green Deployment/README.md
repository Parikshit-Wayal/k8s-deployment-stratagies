## üìù Short Report

### 1. Steps Taken to Set Up Blue-Green Deployment

- **Set up Minikube Cluster**
  - Installed and started Minikube for local Kubernetes testing.  

- **Created Deployments:**
  - **Blue Deployment** ‚Üí current stable version (previous project image).

  - **Green Deployment** ‚Üí new/updated version (open-source random image).  
    ![Green Deployment](./images/green.png)  

- **Exposed Services:**
  - Created **live.yml** for production traffic.  
  - Created **test.yml** for testing updated version.

- **Validated Access in Browser:**
  - Blue App running and accessible.

### 2. Switching Traffic (Blue ‚ûù Green)

- Updated the `live.yml` Service selector from:  
  ```yaml
  version: blue
  targetPort: 3000
--- 

**Result:**  
Traffic shifted to **Green version** instantly without downtime.  

---

### 3. Rollback Strategy

If any issue occurs with Green version:  
- Update Service selector back to **Blue**.  
- Apply again ‚Üí traffic instantly shifts back.  

‚úÖ Achieved rollback with **zero downtime**.

### 4. Tools and Kubernetes Components Used

- **Minikube** ‚Üí Local Kubernetes cluster setup  
- **Deployments** ‚Üí Separate Blue & Green versions  
- **Services (NodePort)** ‚Üí To expose both versions on browser  
- **YAML Manifests** ‚Üí Defined deployments & services (`blue.yml`, `green.yml`, `live.yml`, `test.yml`)  
- **kubectl** ‚Üí Applied changes, switched traffic, and validated rollout

### 5. Issues Faced and How They Were Resolved

- **Issue:** Application port mismatch in Express app (3006)  
  **Solution:** Updated `containerPort` in deployment YAML.  

- **Issue:** Confusion while switching traffic between versions  
  **Solution:** Used Service selector (`version: blue/green`) for seamless routing.  

- **Issue:** Browser not reflecting updated app immediately  
  **Solution:** Cleared NodePort cache and re-verified with:  
  ```bash
  minikube service <service-name>
