# 🟡 What Is a Canary Deployment?

A canary deployment is a strategy for releasing new application versions **safely and gradually** on Kubernetes (or any modern platform).  
Instead of updating all users to the new version at once, you let only a **small set of users** ("the canary group") try out the new version first.

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: How a Canary Deployment Works

1. **Prepare Two Versions**
    - You have the **current stable version** running (let’s call it v1).
    - You build and containerize the **new version** you wish to roll out (v2).

2. **Deploy the New Version as a Canary**
    - Update the Kubernetes Deployment or Service so that a **few pods (or a small % of traffic)** use the new version (v2), and the **rest remain on v1**.

3. **Split User Traffic**
    - The Kubernetes service/load balancer splits requests:
        - **Most users** still get v1.
        - **A few users** (random or targeted) get v2.
    - (This is the "canary" group—named after the canaries miners once used to detect dangerous gases, since only a “few” try it first.)

4. **Monitor and Validate**
    - Closely track traffic, error rates, latency, and user feedback from those seeing v2.
    - If everything looks good, no errors or complaints—proceed to the next step.
    - If you see issues, runtime errors, or alerts—stop and rollback.

5. **Roll Forward or Roll Back**
    - **If no issues:** Gradually increase the number of users seeing v2, step by step, until 100% use the new version.
    - **If problems:** Instantly revert traffic so everyone goes back to v1—only a small group is ever affected.

## 🎯 Purpose and Advantages

- **Reduce risk:** Only a few users exposed if something goes wrong.
- **Quick rollback:** Instantly route all users to stable version if there’s a problem.
- **Faster feedback:** Detect production bugs or user feedback before full rollout.
- **Safer, smoother upgrades:** Avoids “big bang” failures and downtime.

---

## 🛠️ Where It’s Used

- Mission-critical server and web application updates.
- Rolling out new features with minimal disruptions.
- SaaS companies, banks, big tech services—all use canary deployments for reliable continuous delivery.

---

## 📊 Related Concepts

- **Blue/Green deployment:** Switches all traffic from old to new at once (different from canary’s gradual traffic shifting).
- **A/B testing:** Sometimes confused with canary; A/B is for experiments, canary is for safe releases.

## 💡 Simple Workflow Diagram

1. Deploy v1 (all users)  
2. Deploy v2 (canary) → Route 5-10% of traffic to v2  
3. Monitor metrics  
4. Rollout fully (or rollback) based on results

**In summary:**  
A canary deployment lets you safely deliver new updates to your users, protecting both your app and your customers from bugs and outages!
